### Colour Scheme

The website uses a cool palette based on shades of blue and was selected using https://colorhunt.co.

![Site Solutions Website Colour Palette](/assets/images/readme/color-palette.webp)

- Pros
   - Limited and clean colour palette.
- Cons
   - Might be too limiting and void of color.
   - Difficult to create enjoyable contrasting colours.
   
### Reflecting on the colour scheme.

I discovered that the colour scheme was too clean and corporate and hard to integrate with additional colours. If I were to choose again, I would pick something that allowed for more creativity.

### Typography

I decided to use [Google Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto/) fonts. Specifically the Noto Sans font for the body text with a fall back of sans-serif. The Noto Serif was used for the headings with serif as the fall-back font.

![Noto Sans](./assets/images/readme/noto-sans-font.webp)
![Noto Serif](./assets/images/readme/noto-serif-font.webp)

- Pros
   - Comprehensive language support: Noto fonts a wide range of languages and scripts making them great for visual harmony with compatible heights and stroke thicknesses among the many different languages.
   - Open-source and free to use.
   - High-quality design by Google.
   - Good legibility. They are designed to be easily readable on screens making them suitable for web.
   - Easy to use with Google fonts. You can easily integrate the fonts into your web project with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Cons
   - Local implementation: Finding the woff2 files to host locally took a bit of detective work. However, importing or using `<link>` to load the css is quite simple.
   - Limited font variations: Noto Sans and Noto Serif come in various weights but do not offer much with stylistic variations.
   - Overuse: They do not provide a unique or distinctive look where less common fonts may excel.

### Font Implementation

I initially used `@import` to load the Noto fonts. However, this produced some 'opportunities' in lighthouse to improve the performance aspect of my site since `@import` defers the loading of the file until it is fetched, which negatively impacts performance by blocking the rendering of the page until the fonts are loaded. This led me to experiment with using `<link>` to access Google Fonts but I wanted to decrease potential latency even further.

After a bit of searching, I was able to manually download the woff2 files and self host the [Noto Sans font](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&family=Noto+Serif:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap%22%20rel=%22stylesheet) and the variable font file for [Noto Serif](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif:wdth,wght@62.5..100,100..900&display=swap), which positively impacted the performance.
